# Graph Streams at Pomona

This repo is a collection of resources regarding Pomona College research into
temporal analysis of graphs.


## `temporal_paths/` 

This directory contains theory documents attempting to solve Temporal Path
problems. Defines contemporaneity and provides several algorithms to
precompute a shortest path database.

## `temporal_patterns/`

This directory contains theory documents developing a pattern-matching framework
for graph queries of graph databases. Defines various temporal semantics for
temporal contemporaneity and provides a fast algorithms. Also indexing and 
preprocessing strategies are explored.

## `python_implementation/`

This directory contains a cripplingly slow (and unusable) DB-oriented 
implementation of the 2012 Survey framework for temporal queries.

## `sql/`

This directory contains sqls used in creating the dblp data set
