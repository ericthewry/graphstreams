\subsection{Adding and removing Candidate Pairs}

As we build the mappings, we will maintain two three pieces of information.  The
mapping-so-far, $M$, the query interval so far $\impApprox(\impVar)(\{ T(e) | (e,f)
\in M\})$, and the data interval so far $\impApprox(m)(\{ T(f) | (e,f) \in M\})$
As noted in Section~\ref{sec:next_query_edge}, we want to minimize the size of
this interval as we build up the mapping, so to minimize computation, we will
update this value each time we add to $M$. So adding the candidate pair
$(e',f')$ to $(M, \impFunc_{1,old},\impFunc_{2,old} )$ will simply be the
computation

\[(M \cup \{(e',f')\}, \impApprox(\impVar)(\{\impFunc_{1,old}, T(e')\}),
\impApprox(m)(\{\impFunc_{1,old}, T(f')\}) )\]

However, removing edges is hard, so we will have to recompute the intervals,
resulting in the computation, where $M = M - \{(e',f')\}$.

\[
  (M',
    \impApprox(\impVar)(\{ T(e) | (e,f) \in M'\}),
    \impApprox(\impVar)(\{ T(f) | (e,f) \in M'\})
\]
