# Isomorphism.py

This is a sql-based temporal graph processing tool that allows for the automatic
generation and computation of subgraph isomorphisms. The algorithm is intended
to be highly customizable so that command line arguments can simply alter which
specific semantics are being run. Currently, the only aspects that are available
are to specify the implicit and explicit semantics, with the ultimate goal of
being able to finely control which algorithm is selected for each piece of the
`genericQueryProcedure` outline.

## Usage

For detailed usage information see `./isomorphism.py -h`. Here are some
specific usage examples:

```
./isomorphism.py db query data -q 5 -d 100 --no-algo

```

Will gain access to the database called `db`, find or create a table called
`query`, and add 5 randomly generated elements, find or create a table called
`data`, and add 100 randomly generated elements. Then it will end without
running any algorithms due to the `--no-algo` flag.  Use the `-C` option to
completely overwrite the tables `query` and `data` if they exist.

Similarly
```
./isomorphism.py db query data +I -S
```
will run the `IMPLICIT` explicit semantics and the `SCONSEC` implicit semantics.


## Profiling

To profile the algorithm, simply use the `profile` script included in the repo
```
./profile isomorphism <arguments...>
```
